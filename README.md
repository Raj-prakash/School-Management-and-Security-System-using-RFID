# School-Management-and-Security-System-using-RFID
The main objective of developing this project is to ensure the security of the students and give the parents relief. School Security System (SSS) is a software which is helpful for students as well as the parents. In this present situation the parents remain unknown whether their ward have reached school or not. It makes the parents unsecured, uncomfortable and worried. Our School Security System informs the parents if their child have reached the school premises or not.
